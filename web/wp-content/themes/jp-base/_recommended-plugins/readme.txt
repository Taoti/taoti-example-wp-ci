When you make a new project using our custom WordPress upstream, copy the plugins your project needs into the wp-content/plugins/ folder. The ones included here are the most commonly used plugins for our projects.

Storing the plugins in the upstream this way prevents the git conflicts that would occur if the plugins were already in the wp-content/plugins/ folder.
